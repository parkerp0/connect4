This is a game of connect4 with a simple engine to decide on moves.
It should be running minimax but I ran out of time to work due to CPRE 288 so it only does maximization
This leads to a number of problems with the engine namly that it will average out states that should be able to know are bad for it
to run the program build with the normal make target and then run with ./build/final
you use a,d to move the selected column and then s to drop the piece.
Goodluck
